            A block is more than just a unit of workâ€”it's a structured way to track your progress and achievements. Each block is filled with data that helps you monitor your advancement. As you complete a block, its progress value reaches 100, marking a job well done!
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 text-center">
            Fun fact: Blocks are inspired by real structures used in Bimtrazer, where they hold a vast amount of data. While these digital blocks are more engaging, they share the same principles of organization and tracking.
